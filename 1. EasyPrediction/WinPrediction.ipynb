    "# Introduction\n",
    "**DotA 2** is a a multiplayer online battle arena game developed by Valve.\n",
    "Two teams, each consisting of 5 players, fighting against each other. Each player picks one out of over 100 heroes (without replacement). The heroes have different abilities and characteristics. Additionally, players can purchase different items. The overall goal is to destroy the base of the opponent. Have a look [at Purge's DotA 2 introduction video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Szj-CloJiI), if you want to have more information.\n",
    "\n",
    "After a game is finished, one can download some of the **game statistics** using the [DotA 2 Web API](https://dev.dota2.com/showthread.php?t=47115). The statistics are used to assess player's performance and to find out about enemies. The Web API returns not all available information, however, the data should be enough to run some data science on it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this mini-project is to **predict which team is going to win**, given the match details from the Web API. For the sake of simplicity, I am going to use the *scikit-learn* package for machine learning. The decision tree can be easily visualized and is chosen as machine learning model. We can interactively change parameters and see the resulting decision tree immediately. If you want to try out more sophisticated models such as the random forest classifier, you can easily do this, since all classifiers are equally built up in scikit learn. However, you cannot use the visualization then.\n",

    "- scikit-learn\n",

    "\n",
    "`jupyter nbextension enable --py widgetsnbextension`\n",

    "# Data Loading\n",

    "Firstly, the data is collected. A script saves my match history into a directory 'data'. Each match' details are saved into a separate json file. The following codes collect all json-files in the data directory and creates a list `match_history_files`  which contains all (relative) paths to the json files."

We do this, because we want scikit-learn to use the item id as categorical variable. Further information on one-hot-encoding can be found [in this HackerNoon post](https://hackernoon.com/what-is-one-hot-encoding-why-and-when-do-you-have-to-use-it-e3c6186d008f).\n",

Notice, that other values such as the mean could be suitable, too."

    "# Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's do the real classification. Here is some stuff going on which I a going to describe now in more detail:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We do a **train/test-split** on our dataset. We use this as a measure to find out if our model is overfitting. Overfitting means, that the model adopted the noise of the dataset and is not able to generalize. The train dataset is used to train the model and the test dataset is used to evaluate the model. During the training process, the test dataset is not used.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. We define a function **plot_tree**, which takes some parameters which are also used by the decision tree. This is used for the interactive visualization later. The paramters of the plot_tree functions can be set with the interactive visualization. We then train a DecisionTree classifier and calculate the accuracy on the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. We **train the decision tree**. One point to mention is the **`class_weight='balanced'` parameter**. Because we do not have an equal amount of wins/losts, we need to tell the classifier that the class weights should be balanced. Think about the following case: If I won only 1 out of 100 games, the classifier could simply say \"You lose\" without doing any real classification. If we do not balance, the classifier would have an accuracy of 99%. However, if the reason for the low amount of wins is only because of a very unfortunate train/test split (image, that in the test set I win 80% of the games), the classifier fails to generalize. In order to overcome this, we tell the classifier to balance the classes. If you want to read more about this, go to the [decision tree documentation page of scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. We calculate the **importance of the different features** of the classifier. This gives insight on how the classifier works internally and which factors are important to win. Notice, that just because you were able to deal a lot of damage to a tower does not automatically imply that you are winning. It is just an indicator, a hint. (It's a bit like with [Correlation does not imply causation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUti6vGctQM))."
